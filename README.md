##Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

Problem Statement

In today's competitive business landscape, customer retention is critical for long-term success. This project aims to develop a predictive machine learning model** that can identify customers who are at risk of churning â€” that is, leaving the service. Accurately identifying these high-risk customers enables businesses to implement targeted retention strategies, reduce churn rates, and increase overall customer satisfaction and loyalty.

 Dataset Description

The dataset includes customer information such as demographics, usage behavior, and billing details. Below are the key features:

* `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier
* `Name`: Name of the customer
* `Age`: Customer age
* `Gender`: Male or Female
* `Location`: City (e.g., Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, New York)
* `Subscription_Length_Months`: Duration of subscription
* `Monthly_Bill`: Monthly charge
* `Total_Usage_GB`: Total usage in gigabytes
* `Churn`: Binary value (1 = churned, 0 = retained)

Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

   * Null value handling
   * Categorical encoding
   * Feature scaling
   * PCA for dimensionality reduction

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   * Univariate and bivariate plots
   * Correlation matrix
   * Churn distribution by demographic attributes

3. Model Building

   * Tried multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
   * Applied ensemble and deep learning approaches

4. Hyperparameter Tuning

   * Used `GridSearchCV` for optimal parameter selection

5. Model Evaluation

   * Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix used to select the best-performing model

6. Model Interpretation

   * Used `SHAP` and `VIF` to interpret model decisions and identify key features influencing churn

 Outcome

The final model accurately predicts churn likelihood using customer demographics and usage patterns. It allows the business to:

* Identify at-risk customers before they leave
* Implement targeted offers and communication
* Optimize customer service resources
* Reduce churn rates and increase customer lifetime value

Future Improvements

* Deploy the model via Flask or Streamlit
* Connect to real-time customer databases
* Add automated alerts for high-risk users
* Use LSTM/GRU models for temporal usage patterns.
